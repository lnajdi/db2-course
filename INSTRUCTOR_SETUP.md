## üöÄ Quick Setup for Instructors

### GitHub Classroom Setup:
1. Create assignment from this template repository
2. Students will automatically get individual repositories
3. Environment automatically configures with PostgreSQL + Pagila database
4. All lab materials are pre-populated

### Manual Setup (Non-Classroom):
1. Fork or download this repository
2. Students can use GitHub Codespaces or local Docker
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start PostgreSQL
4. Environment auto-configures on first startup

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema (Pagila)
The course uses the Pagila database - a sample DVD rental store database that provides:
- Real-world complexity without overwhelming beginners
- Rich relationships for JOIN practice
- Temporal data for time-series analysis
- Hierarchical structures for advanced queries

### Key Tables:
- **customer**, **address**, **city**, **country** - Customer data
- **film**, **category**, **actor**, **film_actor** - Movie catalog
- **inventory**, **store**, **staff** - Business operations
- **rental**, **payment** - Transaction records

## üìä Assessment Guidelines

### Grading Rubric:
Each lab is worth 100 points distributed as:
- **Correctness (60%)**: Solutions work and produce correct results
- **Code Quality (20%)**: Clean, well-commented, efficient code
- **Analysis (20%)**: Thoughtful answers to analytical questions

### Time Estimates:
- **Lab 01-02**: 2-3 hours each (Beginner)
- **Lab 03-04**: 3-4 hours each (Intermediate)
- **Lab 05-07**: 4-5 hours each (Advanced)
- **Lab 08**: 3-4 hours (Beginner-Intermediate)
- **Lab 09-10**: 4-5 hours each (Advanced)
- **Lab 11**: 4-5 hours (Intermediate)

### Difficulty Progression:
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ Labs 1-2, 8: Beginner
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ Labs 3-4, 11: Intermediate  
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ Labs 5-6, 9-10: Advanced
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Lab 7: Expert

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Student Environment:
- GitHub Codespaces (recommended) or local Docker
- VS Code with PostgreSQL extension
- Access to PostgreSQL 15 with Pagila database

### Instructor Tools:
- Access to student repositories for review
- PostgreSQL client for testing solutions
- GitHub Classroom dashboard for progress tracking

## üìù Lab Management

### Solution Files:
- Students work in `solutions.sql` files (gitignored by default)
- Instructors can access through GitHub Classroom
- Template files provide structure and guidance

### Auto-Grading Potential:
- SQL solutions can be tested against expected outputs
- Consider implementing automated testing for objective questions
- Manual review recommended for analytical components

## üéØ Learning Outcomes Assessment

### By Lab Completion, Students Should:
1. **Design efficient database views** for data abstraction
2. **Optimize query performance** using indexes and materialized views
3. **Manage transactions** with appropriate isolation levels
4. **Perform advanced analytics** with window functions and CTEs
5. **Implement business logic** using stored procedures and triggers

### Assessment Methods:
- **Practical Exercises**: Hands-on SQL development
- **Performance Analysis**: Query optimization tasks
- **Design Decisions**: Justification of technical choices
- **Troubleshooting**: Debugging and problem-solving

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Environment Problems:
